<h1 align='center'>GroupsApp.getGroupByEmail Exception: Cannot find a group named {group name}</h1>

I am a beginner of Google APP Script.

At first, I created a group called `group1` in my domain, then I wanted to list all the members in this new group.

When I clicked Run, the error happened and it was shown as below:

> エラー	Exception: Cannot find a group named: group1@mydomain
> 
> at [unknown function](コード:191:23)
